# Obsidian Notes for Skell's Quest

## Why is this public?
I spend a lot of time working on my projects. I wanted to have a reasonable way to create tasks and bug tickets for myself, without going through the rigmarole of setting up a Jira or Trello board and figuring out a good way to automate that.

## Obsidian Community Plugins Used
- Templater (Required)
- Emoji Toolbar
- Terminal

## Things to know:
`Alt + N` - New post from template
Posts go into a new folder under `Tasks/` every day, this is formatted as `M.DD-MM-YY`. Every day starts with a `General day notes`, which confirms the time I start working on my project. 
I manually enter the time I finish working on it for the day. I don't put down all the breaks I take, as I'm not too concerned with being too accurate with the timings. I may calculate this properly in future with another template.
