# Skell's Quest

### Core Concept
A single-player 3D RPG taking inspiration from MMORPGs. Players can level up in various stats; Learn many skills; Earn rare drops such as equipment, pets and mounts; Find hidden zones; and uncover the truth behind the cultists takeover of the land.
### Main Features 
#### Story 
A dark cult was brooding and swelling within Hydernia, until they eventually took control of the kingdom. With the lord of the land missing and the once peaceful land of varied and allied races becoming restless, it feels like all hope is lost for the stability of Hydernia. That is until a skeleton popped out...

Play as Skell, a sentient skeleton, who vows to become stronger, smarter, faster and better. Uncover the dark plot of the Cult of Narroz and find what holds you together. 

After all...
