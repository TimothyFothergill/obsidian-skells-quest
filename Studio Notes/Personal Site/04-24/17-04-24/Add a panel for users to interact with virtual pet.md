*Start time:* 22:10

**Story:** 
As the developer,
I want to introduce a panel for users to interact with a virtual pet,
So that people may play with a pet on my site

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Introduce a virtual pet panel.

**Comments:** 
This can become a component which can be introduced to the main scala html file.

The component has its own stylesheet. Panel has been implemented, but it needs styling to sit on the side.

Perhaps we have some JS to open/close the virtual pet?
