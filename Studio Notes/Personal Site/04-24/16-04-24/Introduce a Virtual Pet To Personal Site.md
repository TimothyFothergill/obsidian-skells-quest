**Story:** 
As the developer of timlah.com,
I want to introduce the concept of a virtual pet,
So users have a reason to come back and interact with content

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Create a virtual pet model.
- Spawn a virtual pet.

**Comments:** 
Virtual pets are a complicated task which require a bunch of thought and planning to implement on a website. I'd like to create a virtual pet model and write a method to create a virtual pet.
