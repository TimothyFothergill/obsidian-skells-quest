Before I got into game development - and indeed before I got into software as a career - I used to have a range of strange hobbies. In fact, in 2020, just before the pandemic swept the world into lockdown, I closed the book on a major chapter in my life. I used to run a social group called GeekOut South-West - And it was there I got to explore a lot of my interests. Then, when Covid-19 hit the world, all of my non-programming hobbies came to a close.

# The End of an Era

My social group lasted from September 2013 until January 2020. During my time running the event, I got to celebrate geek culture with thousands of people. We had people from all walks of life join us, from students through to people in highly paid roles. There was no division; we were a group who came together to play some games, learn about each others hobbies and to share our own.

I've always been techy and heavily into video games; but the only reason the group came about is my first ever anime convention. A friend and I went to the event, I made a costume for about Â£40, I didn't know how to sew, I didn't know about what materials are typically used - and the costume started to fall apart during the first convention day. Despite that, people recognised the character and were excited to see someone doing the outfit. That was all I needed to know - I caught a bug to create costumes and to be a character; to be a cosplayer.
## My History With Cosplay

I bring all this up because I used to do a lot of cosplay; often bad cosplay, as I would rush to get things done last minute. I ran a social group, I ran a website, I had a full time job and I did a lot of travelling, both for the job and for the website. Given all this, it's no surprise that I only really had a couple of cosplays that people thought were good - But every time I donned a costume, it was a lot of fun.
