This website started life purely as a professional portfolio. Well, even before that, it started as a way to learn more about the main language I use at work - Scala. As time went on, I built up a projects page, in which each of my main projects get posted. I then added more complex elements to the site - This blog was developed, I made a walkathon page (which is no longer live). So what's next? Naturally, we break down some of the professional barriers and use this space to chat...

... And for people to adopt their own virtual pets!
# Wait, what?

I'm not kidding, I'm developing a little virtual pet system right here on this website. Growing up in the 90s and early 00s, I was exposed to Neopets. I adored that site, so I figured I can make my own virtual pet on this here site. I don't think it'll be too much longer before it's ready for deployment. At the moment, the virtual pet system is probably about 60% finished. Once the system's finished, I'll deploy it to the site and not announce when it's available - But it should be available on every page.

So for now, once this first iteration is available, you can feed it, clean it, play with it, perhaps even pet it. The Train and Contest buttons will be greyed out, but they'll be in the second update for the system.
## Will These Be Saved?

So, initially these are being stored in cookies. Yes, technically means you'll be able to change values, but eventually I'll do a reset of the pets and you'll be able to have a saved, bound pet for you to raise and train. Perhaps there'll be more? (There should be.)

But yeah, not much else to say for now. Keep your eyes peeled for when that Open/Close NetBitPet button appears!

As always, much love and happy tinkering -
