To everyone who has kept up with me over the past year, to those who discover this site later. Whoever you are, wherever you may be, I wish you a Merry Christmas 2023.

## Christmas Cheer
Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, I like to believe this is truly a season to be happy. Reach out to a friend, a loved one or spend some needed time to yourself. However you celebrate the holiday season, enjoy it the best way you can.

I'm going to spend this festive period trying to relax as much as I can, but also to catch up with all of the great [tutorials and documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=attURV3JWKQ) the Unity team have been putting out recently. That link takes you to YouTube: Level up your code with game programming patterns: Command pattern. There's also [an eBook](https://unity.com/resources/level-up-your-code-with-game-programming-patterns) which seems quite in depth on programming patterns, as well as eBooks for a variety of their recent videos. Worth a read if you're like me and sticking with the engine.
## In Other News
I'm working on revamping the site a bit, so it is better for mobile devices and for accessibility. I expect this'll take me a long time to get through fully, but hopefully some changes will come sooner rather than later.

Much love and try to have a happy, safe festive period and keep on tinkering.
