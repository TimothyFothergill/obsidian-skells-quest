It's been a while since I last put out a blog post, but there has been good reason behind it. I've been hard at work on the next update for Skell's Quest, but real life has gotten in the way.

## Where'd I Go?
Real life really did get in the way... But in all really positive ways. This year, I decided to work on my health as well as a variety of other things. I lost 68lbs this year and have been maintaining that ever since. I'm aiming to lose more next year, as I intend to, eventually, be in the best shape I've ever been.

As well as that, my work had a major shuffle and I moved away from a DevOps role into being a Frontend Developer. The transition hasn't been too bad and I've been adding value to my organisation. The nicest thing about frontend is how immediately your impact is felt and how you can get feedback much easier from external customers, rather than internal.

Finally, I'm up-and-moving. I've lived in the same place for the past 6 years and have now bought a property with my fianc√©. I am looking forward to new beginnings.

## Next Skell's Quest Version When?
I was optimistic when I said I'd have one out in November, but alas, it'll be January. Along with the house move, I've been pumping feature after feature into the new Skell's Quest version including:
- A dungeon
- Normal and Elite trash mobs
- A boss encounter
- Minigames
- New Loot Systems
- An improved inventory system
- New skill types
- New status effects
- Camera fixes
- Cutscenes
- Annnd much more...

## Blog Schedule 2024
Going forward, I want to try to commit to at least 1 post per week. The type of content may change from week to week, sometimes it'll be game development (Though that'll be the core focus I think), but other times it might be Scala, JavaScript, frontend practices that I learn in work and more.

I've also got plans to add more features to this blog, such as gravatar support. You can now be a guest and comment via Disqus on articles. Eventually, guest comments, if they come from a Gravatar email address, should import the users Gravatar details. I always enjoyed working with Wordpress, so adding Gravatar support feels appropriate. Keep your eyes on that!

That's all, this post was partly because I haven't done one in a while, but also to test some functionality out in a Discord server. Shoutout to Darkshoxx for his efforts! Check out [his blog, Darkblox](https://darkblox306287486.wordpress.com) and go [support him on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/darkshoxx).

That's it, thanks for reading this far. Much love and keep on tinkering. -
