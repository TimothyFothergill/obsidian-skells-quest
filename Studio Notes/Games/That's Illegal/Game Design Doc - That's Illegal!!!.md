## Game Elements
That's Illegal!!! is a 3D puzzler where you play as a little cop and it's your job to look out for illegal activities. Illegal activities change per level, where you have to look out for a number of activities and look for the things performing the activities.

People, animals and inanimate objects can be guilty of a crime and once the player finds one, they can accuse the thing of the crime. They then are sent to trial and if the player correctly identified the criminal/s, they are proclaimed GUILTY! and sent to jail. Make x mistakes (3 by default) and the player is sent straight to jail for the illegal act of accusing people of illegal acts.
## Story
You've been hired by the Powers That Be(tm), as you're an attentive member of the Illegal Police. You've been brought in to handle all of the villains and ne'er-do-well's, then you're passed a book. The book of laws. After studying, you head on out to go and uphold the law and sentence all those who would do wrong.
