When a dungeon boss is defeated, players get given drops on each Drop Table (DT) the boss has. Each boss has its own set of DTs, some will only have 2 DTs, some will have up to 6 DTs.

To give players the opportunity to not need to keep re-grinding dungeons, a skill-based Minigame will be offered in exchange for the loot they received. This will take the highest DT's loot away from the player, who then has to complete a 30 sec to 2 min long minigame.

- If the player is successful, they can select the loot they receive from that DT in place of the sacrificed item (they can also select the previously sacrificed item).
- If the player is unsuccessful, they will receive an extra random roll on the DT below the DT of the sacrificed item.

The minigame will be selected at random. This post is to document some of the ideas for minigames and implementation details.

- Where's Skell? - A Where's Wally style game
- Skilled Tile Swapper - A tile-swapping game with a 3x3 grid
- Gemologist's Curse - Match-3 game using Gemology objects
- Super Skell's World - A 1-level platformer
- ... 6 more maybe?

As a way to prevent players _only_ doing this, Jake points out there should be a reason to get duplicate items anyway. Two things I can think of:
- Deconstruction for materials
- Trade-in for something else

Maybe we could do a system where any item can be traded in for a token outside of the dungeon which will reward you with either different gear sets, cosmetics or other.
