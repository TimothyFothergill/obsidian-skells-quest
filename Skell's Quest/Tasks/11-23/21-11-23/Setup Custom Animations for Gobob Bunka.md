**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to set up three custom animations and triggers for Gobob Bunka,
So that players are more engaged with exploring the map.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Setup a kill-based trigger for The Devourer's Prison.
- Setup an interactable-based trigger for Fake Wall.
- Setup an interactable-based trigger for Stairs.
