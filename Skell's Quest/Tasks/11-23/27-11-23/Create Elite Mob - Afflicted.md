*Start time:* 08:35

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to create an Elite mob,
So that players have a few tougher encounters within the dungeon

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Create the Elite mob, Afflicted.
- Update Enemy code where necessary.

**Comments:** 
For now, I've just made a variant of the Gobob skin and given it an Axe rather than a Club. I've increased the size of the Afflicted, to give more of a sense of scale.

*Finish time:*
