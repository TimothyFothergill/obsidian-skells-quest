*Start time:* 12:03

**Story:** 
As a player, I want to be given an option to initiate a minigame,
So I can choose if I want to partake in the risk/reward.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make a prompt canvas.
- Make the canvas pop up and select a minigame at random and manage closing it.

**Comments:** 
This work is now complete, with a neat Minigame Manager that handles most of the heavy lifting.

*Finish time:* 12:48
