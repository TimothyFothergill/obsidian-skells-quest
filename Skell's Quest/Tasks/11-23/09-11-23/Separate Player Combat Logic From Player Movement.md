**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to separate out player combat logic from the PlayerMovement script,
So that it's easier to manage and extend as I need

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Separate the player combat and movement logic.

**Comments:** 
This was a simple case of moving code from one script to another. A few bits of tidying was also added in.

*Finish time:* 12:24
