**Story:** 
As a player, I want to be able to activate the Encounters screen,
So I can check my Kill Count and more stats about the creature I faced.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Add a new Quick Access button.
- Enable functionality in UIManager.

**Comments:** 
Turns out I already did the work in the UIManager script!

New Quick Access button added. Functionality works in game now.

*Finish time:* 10:56
