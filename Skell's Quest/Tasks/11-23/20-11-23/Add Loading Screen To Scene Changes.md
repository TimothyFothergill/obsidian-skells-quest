**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure the loading scene is played between scene changes,
So that I can mask any weird jumping effects from the players view.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure the loading screen appears between scene changes.

**Comments:** 
This is going to require some rethinking.

*Finish time:* 23:23
