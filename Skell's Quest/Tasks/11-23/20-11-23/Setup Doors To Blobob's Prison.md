**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to set up some doors to Blobob's Prison,
So that overlevelled/geared players can't just rush straight through the dungeon.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Setup Blobob's Prison Trigger and animation.

**Comments:** 
Animation set up - Doors in place. Just need to make the trigger.
