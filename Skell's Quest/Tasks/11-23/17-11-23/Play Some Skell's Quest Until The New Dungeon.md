**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure the game is back to a stable state,
So that I am confident I can move onto the newest features

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Playtest the game.

**Comments:** 

This comments section will be used to keep track of all bugs found:

- ~~**STOP** major bug found - When doing collect quests, it is automatically set to 16?~~
- Minor: Impious Buns still get stuck on terrain; so do Gobobs when respawning.
	- This might be more than minor as it's frustrating.
- Minor UI: Collection quests always display "1" if the slot has 1 or more of an item.
- **Major UI**: Trainer Screen doesn't appear if a quest is complete by MultiNPC
- Major UI: Craft Screen sometimes just stops working..?

*Finish time:* 00:56
