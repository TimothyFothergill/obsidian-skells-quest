**Tags:** #Scene #SceneSwapping

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to provide a means for players to get between scenes,
So that the players can go between scenes and persist progress

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure swapping between scenes works as expected.

**Comments:** 
This was a bit of fiddling with trying to get the script to swap scenes, learning the difference between the default setting and 'Addition' setting for LoadScene methods.

Next will need to attach this to the loading scene, but that will need a bit of rewriting.
