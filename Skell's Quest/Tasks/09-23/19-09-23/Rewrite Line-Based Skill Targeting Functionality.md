**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to rewrite the newly created line-based skill collisions,
So that it can correctly change targets as and when required.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Rewrite Line AOE Skill collision detection and targeting system.

**Comments:** 
This work can form the basis of updating the targeted AOE skills too.
