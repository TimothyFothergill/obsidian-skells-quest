**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to add in a line-based skill,
So that I can test out new occlusion-based restrictions.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make a new Line-Based skill.
- Write all relevant code to a line-based skill.

**Comments:** 
When I say line-based, this is an area of effect skill which is in a straight line.

New Line-Based skill has been made.
