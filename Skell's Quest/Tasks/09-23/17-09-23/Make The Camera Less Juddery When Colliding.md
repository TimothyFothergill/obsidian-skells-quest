*Start time:* 21:16

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to stop the camera flying off into space if it hits an obstacle,
So that I don't get so nauseous when playing the game...

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make the cinemachine camera chill out a bit.

**Comments:** 
Cinemachine has been instrumental for making the camera system smooth and predictable, however it does have issues when hitting big obstacles.

I reduced the Smoothing Time on the third person camera and this made a significant difference to the jumpiness of the camera. It's still not fully addressed all of the concerns, but a good first step.

*Finish time:* 21:27
