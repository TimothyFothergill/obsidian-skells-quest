**Story:** 
As a player, I want to be able to access a settings/options screen,
So that I can make changes to the game as I see appropriate

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- An options screen which can be called upon in the Esc menu.
- At least two changeable options.

**Comments:** 
Started by making a typical screen in game, adding some labels and adding some toggles.
Made one of the toggles an "Always Run" option. Hooked it up to the Player Movement and set the toggle correctly.


*Finish time:* 09:03

Notes:
Easy little bit of work, useful foundation for the future.
