*Start time:* 12:08

**Story:** 
As a player I would like the size of the skill bar to be much smaller,
So that I get more screen visibility.

As a player I would like the option to set the size of the skill bar,
In case I have vision difficulties.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make the skill bar smaller by default.
- Code in some options to allow players to set the size of the skill bar.

**Comments:** 

Found a Code Monkey video to help understand zooming with Cinemachine.

There's no built-in way to handle zooming.
