**Notes:**
I spent a good portion of the day away, however I managed to write a new blog post and advertised it on Mastodon. I also managed to get icons appearing in text. I do need to consider how to address the icons being lower than the rest of the text, though. I also fixed a longstanding issue with the crafting, whereby you would get the channelling bar even if you don't have the materials.
