**Story:** 
As a player, I would like to be able to load my save file from Cloud Save,
So that I don't need to worry about where files are saved when I play the game on `play.unity.com`

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure players can load from the cloud.

**Comments:** 
This is an extension of last nights work - This is the opposite end of the task, now that I know how to save to Cloud Save, I want to make sure I can load from it, too.

Been having difficulties with this today and will take the remainder of the day off from it. The difficulty I have is: The object saves pretty easily, but the deserialization process may need a bunch of helper methods to deal with unwrapping the data on load. I will investigate this more tomorrow.
