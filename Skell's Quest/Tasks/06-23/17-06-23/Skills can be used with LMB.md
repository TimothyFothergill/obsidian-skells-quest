**Story:** 
As a player, I would like to have the option to use skills with the LMB,
So that I don't need to use the keyboard for everything

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Clickable skills on the skill bar.

**Comments:** 
This was as simple as adding the new feature into the SkillSlot script and adding a button component to the prefab.
