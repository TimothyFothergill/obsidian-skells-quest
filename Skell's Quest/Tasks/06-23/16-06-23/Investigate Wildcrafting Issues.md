**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure all of Wildcrafting works as expected,
So that I don't run into any issues whilst playing the game

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Playtest and investigate if there are any outstanding Wildcraft issues.
- Playtest the full game as is so far.

**Comments:** 
A full playtest showed I was able to not only correctly make the wildcraft crates, but also capture an impious bun for its horn and then grind the horn. One point of note is there is no item that utilises this.

Follow up ticket to sit in unassigned: Make an Impious Horn potion to increase an attribute for x time.
