**What I fixed:**
The Multi-NPC Interaction - Where the player can click on one of the dialogue options (Shop, Quest, Trainer etc).

**Comments:**
After looking into this and investigating, I noticed the change to the dialogue screen caused this. A change of the background and a change of the size was all this needed.
