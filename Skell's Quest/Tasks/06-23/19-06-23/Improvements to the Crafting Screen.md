**Story:** 
As the developer, I would like to improve the UX of the Crafting Screen,
So that navigating the screen is simpler.

As a player, I would like to be able to have more options within the Crafting Screen,
So I can play the game in a way that doesn't hinder me whilst doing crafting.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- UX improvements to current crafting screen.
- Craft, Craft-x and Craft All buttons.
- Embedded channelling bar.

**Comments:** 
I started by getting a new button in place for Craft All, resizing the buttons and making sure those worked as intended.

Next I implemented a version of the channelling timer into the craft screen.

I then updated the panels to make them look a bit more professional and I also updated the RecipeSlot and CraftableSlot.

I just need to find a way to make the RecipeSlot script work in the way I intend. Will resume this work tomorrow.
