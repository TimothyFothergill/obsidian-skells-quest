**Story:** 
As a player, I want to be able to press Esc to get to a menu,
So that I can play with settings, quit the application and more.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Esc brings up a menu. (/) 
- The menu has options. (/)
- The options bring you to other screens as appropriate.

**Comments:** 
There appears to be some oddness in the UIManager around abilityPanel. Might be worth investigating and documenting it.

**Notes:**
Just need to add options screens as appropriate now.
