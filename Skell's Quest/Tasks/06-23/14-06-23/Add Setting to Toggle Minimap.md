**Story:** 
As a player, I would like to have the option to enable or disable the minimap,
So that I can decide how much room I want on my screen.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Functionality to toggle minimap.
- A toggleable setting in the Settings screen.

**Comments:** 
A very simple task which just extends UIManager's functionality more, making it even more tightly focused.

*Finish time:* 22:50
