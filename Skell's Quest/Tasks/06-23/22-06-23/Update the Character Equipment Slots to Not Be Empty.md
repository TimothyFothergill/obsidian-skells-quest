**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to set up the Player Loadout screen to not make the slots turn white,
So that the game has a lot more polished feel to it

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Update the background of Equipment Slots when equipping and unequipping items.

**Comments:** 
This was just a case of finding what the background sprite was, then adding it instead of null when a slot is empty.

*Finish time:* 20:08
