*Start time:* 23:06

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to fix the inventory
Because I'm bored of having to make Fix The Inventory tickets.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Fix the inventory...
- Fix it...
- ... pls.

**Comments:** 
More work to be done...

This is finally fixed... I can't document everything that was done.

Man this was a bad ticket.

*Finish time:* 12:18 - many days later...
