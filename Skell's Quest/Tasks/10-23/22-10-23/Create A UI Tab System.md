**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make a tab system,
So that I can use it for different UI screens.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make a Tab System for UI.

**Comments:** 
I started by making a `TabGroup` component which would let you define what falls within a group of buttons.

There's a lot of complicated details in this, but there are two different types of tab groups, normal ones which expect an image and text ones which are populated from a different tab.
