*Start time:* 22:10

**Story:** 
As a player, I want to be able to track some stats like kills and drops,
So that I can make a judgement about whether to grind a mob or not.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Create an encounters screen with the new `TabGroup` class.

**Comments:** 

We have a screen now that has two tabs, which allow us to select and bring up a dialogue box for further tabs:

The next step is to design the base content area in the middle of this screen and ensure to display useful stats, which will come from a `PlayerKillLog`.
