*Start time:* 23:19

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure the inventory is completely usable again,
So that the inventory is back to its previous state but can have multiple items per slot.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure the inventory slots are working as expected again.
	- This includes Equipment.

**Comments:** 
When I reworked the inventory to introduce a quantity per slot, the inventory slots somewhat broke. Just a small task to get back into the swing of things after two weeks of uncertainty.
