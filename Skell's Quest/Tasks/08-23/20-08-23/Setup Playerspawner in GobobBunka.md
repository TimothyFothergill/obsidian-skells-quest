**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to add a GameObject with the `playerspawner` tag in the dungeon,
So that players can respawn if they die in the dungeon.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Add an empty GameObject with the playerspawner tag.
- Test respawning works as intended.

**Comments:** 
Quick and easy task, nothing more to say here.
