**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to decouple the enemy script even more,
So that I can find performance gains and fix some long standing bugs

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Decouple the Enemy script further.

**Comments:** 
These tasks have been difficult for me. A lot of it has been about knowing where to get stuck in.

Previously, I fixed up some issues around the enemies going back to their home location and fixed a few basic bugs. Now, I'm going to look to get more things out of the update method where possible.

Some functionality has been split up, some of the code has been removed as it was unnecessary. I've updated some of the scripts around the animations, so that works much smoother now and is a lot more responsive.

I need to add in a hurt animation and a stun animation (at least). I also have a special attack animation on the normal Gobobs. Two waves in the dungeon will be 4 Gobobs, so getting them down will be great.

Tomorrow I need to focus on stopping them from targeting the player if they can't see the player, as this could prove problematic.
