**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make certain objects interactable for lore purposes,
So that the game can be filled with rich objects that set the scene for the player.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Create a script that allows players to interact with lore objects.

**Comments:** 
In this dungeon, there are three book lore objects, which need to be interactive.

In the interests of time, I've just repurposed the Sign script for now. This will need to be updated with a book-like asset that can be flicked through, but for now this will get us off the starting block.
