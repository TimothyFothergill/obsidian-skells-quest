**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure enemies return home when they defeat the player,
So that they don't get stuck in a combat loop.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make sure enemies return to their spawn points when the player's defeated.

**Comments:** 
This is now working, although introducing this caused a new bug where multi-enemies don't attack simultaneously.
