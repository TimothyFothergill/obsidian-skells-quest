**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to give enemies an override to determine what attacks they use and when,
So I can develop custom combat patterns for some enemies and randomised attacks for others.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Introduce an override to the attack patterns.

**Comments:** 
This was a case of introducing a list of a new class of AttackPatterns and managing the state from there.

I can extend these further by introducing new elements to the OverridableAttackPattern class, including things such as HP overrides.
