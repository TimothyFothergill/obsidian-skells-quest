**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to create my first boss model,
So that I can import it and get to work on it in Unity soon

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make Blobob, the Scourge of the Valley's model in blender.
- Make some animations.

**Comments:** 

Took some time to make sure Blobob looks as I'd expect it to. This involved following a few tutorials and remembering where everything was in Blender, but I got there!

Then for the first time, I made animations in Blender. I have created animations for:

- Idle
- Movement
- Attack
- Special Attack
- Death

Imports well, although the inside of Blobob isn't showing up. This is to do with normals, so I will investigate that another time.
