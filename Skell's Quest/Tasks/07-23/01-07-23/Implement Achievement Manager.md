**Story:** 
As the developer, I would like a way for the achievements states to be managed,
So that players can earn an achievement once and not keep getting rewards for it.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Implement an Achievement Manager.

**Comments:** 
An achievement manager needs to be able to understand what achievements have and have not been earned. An easy way to implement this is for a simple class which can be toggled one way, which contains the ScriptableObject for the achievement and a bool for whether the achievement has been earned or not.
