**Notes:**
A lot of progress was made today on the Save Manager, to where we're at a basic state. It doesn't save the state of number of kills done, but it does do almost everything else including loadout, unlocked abilities and more.

Also made a primitive title scene and a loading scene. Tomorrow's work will be to get the loading scene to work, then to test the game and see what else "needs" to be done before this version goes live.
