**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure the players can load their loadout,
So that Skells do not load in without their hard earned equipment.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make sure the character loadout can be saved.
- Make sure the character loadout can be loaded.

**Comments:** 
Continuation of the SaveManager epic... Yikes.

This ended up being a lot easier than I expected. I managed to have the whole thing working pretty quickly following a similar pattern to before and just populating each of the equipment slots with the relevant gear.
