**Story:** 
As the developer, I would like to add a neat looking title screen,
So that players don't have to wait for a long time waiting for the game to load immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Introduce a title scene.
- Ensure the title scene can get to the game.

**Comments:** 
Created a new basic Title Scene to get going and a Loading Scene.

Made a script to move from Title Scene to Loading Scene. Tomorrow's work will include working with the Loading Scene.
