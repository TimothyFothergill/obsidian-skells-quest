**Story:** 
As the developer, I want utmost confidence that the next build of Skell's Quest will be smooth,
So that players have a smooth experience.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure Skell's Quest v0.0.4 is ready to go.
- Document any new bugs.

**Comments:** 
Playing through three bugs were found:

- Inventory item info panel appears behind inventory panel, moved order.
- Stats screen fell down. I dunno. Moved it.
- CompleteButton not being set properly only on MultiNPC. Fixed!

Also set Select noise for the title screen.

Everything else working.
