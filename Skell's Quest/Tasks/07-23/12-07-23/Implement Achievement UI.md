**Story:** 
As a player, I would like to have a simple, understandable achievement UI screen,
So that I can see all of the available and completed achievements

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- New UI panel for the Achievement Journal.

**Comments:** 
This took a bit of time, but for now I decided to just have a very basic screen to show the current achievements. This can take on a new, improved shape in the next update. 

I'll need to make a tab system.
