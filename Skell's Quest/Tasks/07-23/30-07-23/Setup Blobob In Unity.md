**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to set up the new boss Blobob in Unity,
So that it's ready to be placed in the game world.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Setup the Blobob prefab in Unity.
- Ensure the normals that were not working yesterday are fixed.

**Comments:** 
First I duplicated the body in Blender and inverted its normals, so that there was an inside. Then I gave it a very dark material to create a natural chasm-like look inside. I also put some of the green around the eyes, acting like eye sockets.

Next, I made sure the animations worked and I set up the boolean values for the animations. I tested each animation in the game and tweaked speeds as appropriate.
