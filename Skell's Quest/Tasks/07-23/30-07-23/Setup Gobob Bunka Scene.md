**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to set up a basic scene and layout for Gobob Bunka,
So that it is an explorable new zone for the game, which will get monsters and a boss.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Find a useful Dungeon asset from the asset store.
- Setup a basic scene for the Gobob Bunka.
- Ensure things can be placed in the scene.

**Comments:** 
The asset I selected was this: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/ultimate-low-poly-dungeon-143535

There's a lot to play around with in that asset, so hopefully when people go into this dungeon, they'll enjoy looking around. I'll need to make Chests with random drop, tied to that dungeon.

Grabbed a few sound assets from Incompetech - Now that there's multiple scenes, I think I'll need to make a Dictionary for Scene -> Music.

Started to piece together a couple of assets to start to form the basis of the dungeon. I had an idea of a rough layout for this.
