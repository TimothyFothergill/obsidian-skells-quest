**Story:** 
As the developer, I would like to add a notification type for Achievements,
So that players are visually rewarded for the completion of an achievement.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- New prefab for the AchievementNotification.
- Prefab is called upon where necessary.
- Code for the NotificationManager updated to introduce the AchievementNotification type.

**Comments:** 
This was mostly fiddling around with the UI system and making a new AchievementNotification prefab. The prefab is functional and looks fine, albeit a bit bland.

After that, it was just a case of fiddling around with the NotificationManager a bit to add a new type of Notification and add a new NotificationZone.

This ended up being a relatively easy task, which gave me more confidence in the NotificationManager.
