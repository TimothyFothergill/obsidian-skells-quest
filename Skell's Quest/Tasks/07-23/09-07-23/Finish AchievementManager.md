**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to finish implementing the AchievementManager system,
So that it can manage all Achievements going forward

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Achievements registering in the AchievementManager.
- Achievement state is held separately.
- Achievements reward players once only.

**Comments:** 
This ended up being some tidying of loose ends. I had worked hard on trying to make ScriptableObjects understand the state of the Scene, when in reality all I needed to do was create a wrapper object for each Achievement. 

I am glad this painful work is over.

*Finish time:* 16:05
