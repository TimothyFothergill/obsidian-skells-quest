**Story:** 
As a player, I would like to see a progress bar as the game loads,
So that I don't have to worry that the game is hanging when it isn't

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Write a loading progress bar script.

**Comments:** 
Last night I prepared the scene for the loading bar.

This was a very simple script which looks at the progress of an AsyncOperation. AsyncOperation is a class which can be accessed on any asynchronous operation and provides a property for the progress of the operation.
