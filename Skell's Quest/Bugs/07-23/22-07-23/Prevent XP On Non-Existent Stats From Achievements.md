**What I fixed:**
Earning an achievement gives XP to a stat that doesn't exist.

**Comments:**
Double checked the achievement code and this seemed to be okay. However, after tweaking a few things with the amethyst nodes, this seemed to resolve itself. Uncertain of the cause or resolution, but it's working I guess.
