**What I fixed:**
There's an offset for Sprite Assets of about 25px on the y axis. Uncertain what's caused this, but increasing global offset of 25y fixes this. Had to remember to Apply the change, as otherwise Unity falls over.

**Comments:**
There's still some issues with this, but this is better than it was.
