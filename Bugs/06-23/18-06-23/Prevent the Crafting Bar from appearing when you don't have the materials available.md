**What I fixed:**
This was a stupid bug where I set the channelling timer to start before it determines whether or not a user has met the required materials. This wasn't a big problem, but it was enough of an inconvenience to be off-putting to crafting.

**Comments:**
This was as simple as moving a line of code in the CraftStation script.
