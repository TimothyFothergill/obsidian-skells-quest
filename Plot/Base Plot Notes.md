The kingdom was a safe, kind kingdom in which all of the races pulled together and lived in harmony. The lord of the land had been appointed, selected by unanimous decision by the leaders of each of the seven diplomatic races. 

Meanwhile, a dark cult was brewing. The kingdoms harmony outlawed research into the occult, electing to arrest and destroy occultist studies. A hermit of a dark mage, Zargak, had enough. He swore a blood oath, asking any higher power to bestow him the power to take the fight to the lord of the land. One higher being heard his call and bestowed him vile dark magics. 

Years of indoctrinating those who got arrested pass by, a battle is waged on the keep. No one saw it coming, because there were no known enemies to the lord - And that was their downfall. 

After landing what was assumed to be the finishing blow to the lord, Zargak didn't know where they went... But not that it mattered, for he had control of the keep now. He would try to educate people that occultism isn't bad, just has some... Questionable methods to their studies. 

One year passes, the diplomatic races tensions are at an all time high. The cultists have a foothold in all major towns and cities. Trade to and from the kingdom has all but dried up, leading to overworked citizens. People are fed up, the monsters have come back and no one seems to make cakes any more. 

One day, a curious skeleton arrives to the Village of Elders. No one could foresee that friendly skeleton was actually going to go on a quest to save them from the cult. But they would need a lot of time and help to get there. 

TL;DR, Skell's the lord, but was hit with a last curse by Zargak, hence their appearance. They're on a quest to defeat Zargak to restore the honour and safety of the land.
