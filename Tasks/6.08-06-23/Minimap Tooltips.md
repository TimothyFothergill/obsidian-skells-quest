**Story:** 
As a player, I want to be able to hover my cursor over the minimap and see a tooltip
So that I know the NPC that I'm pointing at

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- A tooltip that correctly identifies the NPC by its icon.

**Comments:** 
**This has been put on hold**

I created a tooltip and that gets disabled immediately when the game loads, so it doesn't get in the way. On hover over icons, it doesn't enable the tooltip. This needs further investigation between the minimap camera and canvases.
