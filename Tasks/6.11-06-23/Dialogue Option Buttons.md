*Start time:* 11:00

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to change how the Dialogue Option buttons look,
So that they look better than the default Unity buttons.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Create a new texture for the buttons.
- Understand resolution size required for these to come out not-stretched looking.

**Comments:** 
I first thought I could slice an image, but that seems to be not the best approach.

Created a 128 x 32 button icon:

Then I ended up making a bigger Panel Base to make the panels look a bit better:

Then I made a blue button

None of these images I'll be precious to, but it's a big step forward from how it looked before.

Breaks:
11:15-13:00

*Finish time:* 13:30

Notes:
This was a quick and easy task to get started, makes the buttons feel a bit more interesting, too.
