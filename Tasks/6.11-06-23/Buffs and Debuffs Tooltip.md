*Start time:* TBC

**Story:** 
As a player, I would like a tooltip to appear whenever I hover over a buff or debuff,
So that I know what that buff/debuff is doing.

As a player, I would like a timer to appear whenever a buff or debuff is active,
So that I know how long that buff/debuff has left.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- New tooltip Prefab for buffs and debuffs.
- Tooltip Prefab initiates whenever hovering over a buff or debuff.
- New timer appears whenever a buff or debuff is active.

**Comments:** 
Unlike other panels tooltips, such as the inventory system, this one may work better included with the buff/debuff image prefab itself.

Notes: I was due to start this today, but ended up not getting around to it. Will make this the task for tomorrow (12-06-2023)
