**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make the audio tracks fade between one another in AudioSource A,
So that players who enter the boss rooms aren't met with a sudden juxtaposition of sounds.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure the music fades between one another correctly.

This article gives an interesting idea, which is to use an Audio Mixer Group component, which is a new one to me.
