**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to decouple everything within the Enemy script,
So that I don't need to understand what spaghetti code keeps it together.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Assess the Enemy script.
- Decouple all code that can be separated out.

**Comments:** 
This script will take a lot of redoing...

- Got the death animation working again.
- Added new Attack Popup Prompt for Enemies
