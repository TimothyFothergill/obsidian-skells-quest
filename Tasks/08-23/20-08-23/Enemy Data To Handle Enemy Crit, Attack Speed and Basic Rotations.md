**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to be able to let enemies have a bit more control over their attack rotations,
So that I can develop more interesting and complex enemies

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Update Enemy script to utilise crit chance and damage, as well as attack speed.
- Update EnemyStats script to provide an overridable attack pattern.

**Comments:** 
Some serious work was put into making sure that crit chance and crit damage can be altered. As well as this, attack speed has been implemented properly.

The EnemyStats script has been updated to support overridable attack patterns, which will come in handy when sorting out Blobob and some Elite Trash Packs.

The Overridable Attack Pattern needs to be fleshed out in concept; how will this look? What's the process going to be like? is it just going to be a list to work through? Can I make a tree view and have boolean logic associated with it? I'll look into making new inspector tools.

For today though, I'm happy with the work undertaken.
