**Story:** 
As the developer, I want enemies to have a basic attack rotation in their attacks,
So that players aren't only hit with a special attack spam!

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Give enemies a basic attack.
- Ensure the prompt above their head reflects the basic attack.

**Comments:** 
Enemies had a section for "simpler" attacks, however this was a convoluted mess. I've managed to strip away about half of the calculations required here and made it so it does 2 "auto-attacks" (basic attacks) before trying to do a special attack.

These attacks hit really hard. Some balance is needed. It may however also be a good test for players when they come into the dungeon, as some of the gear can nearly one shot these little guys. At the moment, `Gobob Slayer weapons` can one shot anything, which will need to be rebalanced.
