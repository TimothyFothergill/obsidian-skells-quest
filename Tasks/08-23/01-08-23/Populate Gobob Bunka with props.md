**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to put some props around in Gobob Bunka,
So that the level doesn't feel so lifeless.

As the developer, I want to put some zones in for chests,
So I can write a script to spawn in chests at a rate that works.

As the developer, I want to add in some books for players to read,
So they can find out a little bit more about the lore of the game.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Put props around the new Gobob Bunka map.
- Set up locations for chest spawns.
- Set up lore-related book locations.

**Comments:**
