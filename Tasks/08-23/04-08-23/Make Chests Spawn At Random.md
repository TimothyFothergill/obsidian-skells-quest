**Story:** 
As the developer, I'd like to reward players who take the time to look around dungeons,
So that players are incentivised to explore to find extra gear and loot

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Write a script that will make a chest spawn when the dungeon is initiated.

**Comments:** 
I have previously set up an empty GameObject which contains three empty GameObjects which mark the locations of chests.

This was a simple script which gets the number of child GameObjects to the ChestSpawns parent object, then chooses one to spawn the chest/s.
