**Story:** 
As the developer, I want enemies to drop items into the players inventory by default,
So that the game correctly ensures that players are rewarded for their drops

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Enemies drops are put immediately into the players inventory.

**Comments:** 
This was a quick task as we already had the AddToInventory method on PlayerManager.

*Finish time:* 14:58
