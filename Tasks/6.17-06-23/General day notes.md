**Notes:**
A really productive day. Lots done, across a range of different elements of the game. Camera got a much needed fix, enemies now drop items correctly. I've set up Obsidian to be better suited for the little daily tasks. Skills can be pressed with LMB but I do need to fix the Targeted skills with that. Wildcrafting now has a craftable item from the dust.
