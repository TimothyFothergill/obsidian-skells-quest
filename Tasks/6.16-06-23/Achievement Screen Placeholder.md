**Story:** 
As the developer, I'd like to have an achievements screen placeholder,
So that I can develop the logic for achievements later and have something to work with now.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- A new GameObject in UISystem
- Code to support revealing and disabling the achievement screen
- Code to keybind the achievement screen
- Working quick access button

**Comments:** 
This was a very quick bit of work. I managed to complete this within about 20 minutes, setting up the functionality for it to exist. I will need to write achievements objects in future. I spent a bit of time testing to make sure each thing worked as expected and made sure it closed properly with esc.

*Finish time:* 21:50
