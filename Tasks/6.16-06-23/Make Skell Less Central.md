*Start time:* 19:08

**Story:** 
As a player, I would like Skell to be less central,
So that it's easier to see what's happening over Skell's shoulder

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Find a better position for the camera to point to.

**Comments:** 
This is a small task to move the camera in a way that works better by default.

*Finish time:* 19:25

**Notes:**
I think this will be a constant trial and error until it feels just right.
