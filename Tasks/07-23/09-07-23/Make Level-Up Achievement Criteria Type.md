**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to create a Level Up Achievement Criteria type,
So that I can reward players as they play through the game.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- New Achievement Criteria that looks at levels of stats when called.

**Comments:** 
I already had a name for this set, so I started by moving this to its own class file.

This is now started, but due to time of night, decided to call it a night there. Just need to elegantly put the stat in the achievement wrapper.
