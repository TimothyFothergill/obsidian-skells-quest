*Start time:* 14:55

**Story:** 
As a player, I don't want the game to consume an item before it completes its usage timer,
So that I can make decisions to cancel my action without consequence (aside from my own time).

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Prevent items being consumed before the timer completes.

**Comments:** 
This required a little more effort than I initially thought. I needed to pass the list to another class in order for it to correctly be counted.

*Finish time:* 15:20
