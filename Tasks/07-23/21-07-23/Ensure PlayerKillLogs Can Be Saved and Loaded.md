**Tags:** #SaveManager 

**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to ensure PlayerKillLogs are saved and loaded as part of the SaveManager system,
So that players don't lose progress.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Ensure PlayerKillLogs can be saved.
- Ensure PlayerKillLogs can be loaded.

**Comments:** 
This is the final (for now) task of the SaveManager. Ensure players can save and load Player Kill Logs as appropriate.

After lots of thinking, I've decided to put this task back on the backlog. The reason for this is that the PKL's need a revamp which can be introduced with the next update, which is focused on combat and dungeons.
