**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make sure both bank and inventory can be loaded from JSON in the cloud,
So that I don't need to keep worrying about how to implement this in future.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Implement the load for items in the inventory.

**Comments:** 
This forms part of a greater epic of tasks.

This was a quick task. I just needed to create `NukeInventory()` and `LoadInventory(List<ItemBase>())` methods.
