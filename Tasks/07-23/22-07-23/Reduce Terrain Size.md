**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to reduce the amount of wasted terrain,
So that the game is more performant.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Reduce terrain size without affecting current terrain.

**Comments:** 
I found and installed a package called Terrain Tools (often referred to as Terrain Toolbox), which let me cut the size of the terrain down by a lot.

I then had some issues with a texture, so I removed that and then reapplied the missing ground texture (oops).
