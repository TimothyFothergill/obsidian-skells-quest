*Start time:* 20:25

**Story:** 
As a player, I want the resource bars to automatically hide when I'm not in combat
So that I can have more visibility on screen at all times and only have context when needed.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Hidden resource bars.
- Resource bars numbers hidden by default, unless hovered over.

**Comments:** 
This was a quick task, where the resource bars hide by default now. This could become a toggleable option later in the menu.

*Finish time:* 21:00
