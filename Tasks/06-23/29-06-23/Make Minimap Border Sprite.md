**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make a nice border for the minimap,
So that it looks more professional

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- A new border made in GIMP.
- Implemented the new border.

**Comments:** 
Made a simple border in GIMP, moved the NorthMarker outside of the minimap camera GameObject and prevent the NorthMarker from spinning.

Implemented and it looks good!
