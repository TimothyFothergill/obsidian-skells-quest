**Story:** 
As a player, I want to have useful visual hints as to what an NPC can do for me,
So that I can assess and play the game as I see fit.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make sure the in-game icon sprite changes based on what type of NPC it is.

**Comments:** 
This required a bit of an overhaul of the Minimap Icon. This was a case of setting up a switch for the different types of NPCs. Further NPC types can be added and these minimap icons can be updated to support extra types.

Further optimisation of this script is possible, however it'd mostly just be reformatting.
