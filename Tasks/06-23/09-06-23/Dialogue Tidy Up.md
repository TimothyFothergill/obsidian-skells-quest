**Story:** 
As the developer, I want to make the dialogue screen look more sleek,
So that I'm not so embarrassed about people playing the game darn it.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Make the dialogue screen better.
- Sort out buttons.

**Comments:** 
A title panel for the name of the quest would be good.

*Changes:*
- Quest Description: Font size 24
- Quest Title: 
	- Font size 42
	- Panel
	- Raised up
- Remove PlayerImage
- Remove PlayerNamePlate
- Mask on TargetImage
- Target Image moved to top
- Shrink dialogue panel


*Finish time:* 20:35

Notes:
There's more work needed on this - Buttons need a new skin.
