**Story:** 
As the developer, I would like to reward players for their progress throughout the game,
So that it may incentivise players to do tasks they may otherwise not be familiar with.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Introduce a base class for achievements that can be extended.
- Ensure the Achievements Screen can read these Achievements.

**Comments:** 
Started the base class for this - Need to extend this into tomorrow.
