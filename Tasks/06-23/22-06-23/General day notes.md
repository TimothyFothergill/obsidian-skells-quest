**Notes:**
I spent quite a bit of the day investigating saving the game. There's a lot more work that needs to be done on this front, but on the plus side, I've found that saving is pretty straight forward, especially with ES3 and Cloud Save. I just need to see if I can make an ES3 save file and save that encrypted to Cloud Save.
