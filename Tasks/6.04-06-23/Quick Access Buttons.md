**Story:** 
I want to have some buttons in the bottom left hand corner of the screen,
So that I can quickly access various UI elements without needing to strike a keyboard button.

**Acceptance Criteria (as appropriate):**
- Buttons with icons in the bottom right hand corner.
- Buttons correctly open UI elements.

**Comments:** 
For now, I'm focused on making the logic work, so I'll be using existing icons imported from Unity Asset Store.

Initial draft of the look:

The transparent background is unnecessary, so will be removed.

Next I fixed up the UIManager script to make more methods public as they didn't need to be private. This let me open and close the related UI Windows.

*Finish time:* 11:38

Extra notes:
This was a straight forward thing to implement. Achievements and Menu to be implemented at a later date.

Breaks:
11:40-11:55 (15 mins)
